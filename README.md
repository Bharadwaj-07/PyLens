## üöÄ Features

### 1. **Python Profiler (VSCode Extension)**
- Real-time CPU & memory usage tracking
- Displays active functions during execution

- Post-execution panel with:
  - Avg. CPU usage per function
  - Avg. memory usage per function
  - Number of calls
  - Total time and cumulative stats

### 2. **Profiler Notebook (Jupyter Extension)**
- Statement-level timing and CPU usage
- Per-cell summary:
  - Total time
  - Number of operations (hits)
  - Performance classification (Performance-critical, CPU-intensive, Loop-intensive, Memory-intensive)

## Team Contributions
- **Pashaula Eswar Sai [ CS24M109 ]**: Designed and developed the Python Profiler extension, including the real-time dashboard and post-execution function report
- **M Yashwanth Kumar [ CS24M122 ]**: Developed the Profiler Notebook extension, worked on inline metrics capture and cell classification logic. Integrated Profiler extension with Notebook and with Complexity Checker.
- **Gooty Bharadwaj [ CS24M123 ]**: Built the Python Complexity Checker, implemented maintainability index calculations, UI structure, and issue detector logic for large-scale codebases

## Testing
- For testing the features of the tool use "testing" folder.
